  <p>I am a PhD student in the Government department at Harvard. My research focuses on inequality, representation and migration. I often rely on causal inference in observational settings. I am also a research fellow in the Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy at the <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/"> Harvard Kennedy School</a>.  I am currently visiting the <a href="https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality">Institutions and Political Inequality Group</a> at  <a href="https://wzb.eu/en">WZB Berlin</a>. </p>

<b> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12460">Do Inheritance Customs Affect Political and Social Inequality?</a></b> 2019. 
(with Anselm Hager). <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, 63 (4): 758-773.
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('inheritance');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="inheritance" style="display:none;"><br> Why are some societies more unequal than others? The French revolutionaries believed unequal inheritances
among siblings to be responsible for the strict hierarchies of the ancien r´egime. To achieve equality, the revolutionaries
therefore enforced equal inheritance rights. Their goal was to empower women and to disenfranchise the noble class. But do
equal inheritances succeed in leveling the societal playing field? We study Germany—a country with pronounced local-level
variation in inheritance customs—and find that municipalities that historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day,
elect more women into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic data, we point to two
mechanisms: wealth equality and pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also show that, counterintuitively, equitable
inheritance customs positively predict income inequality.We interpret this finding to mean that equitable inheritances level
the playing field by rewarding talent, not status.</div>

<b><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12516">Does Public Opinion Affect Political Speech?</a></b> 2020.
(with Anselm Hager). <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, 64 (4): 921-937. <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('merkel');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="merkel" style="display:none;"><br> Does public opinion affect political speech? Of particular interest is whether public opinion affects (i) what topics politicians address and (ii) what positions they endorse. We present evidence from Germany where the government was recently forced to declassify its public opinion research, allowing us to link the content of the research to subsequent speeches. Our causal identification strategy exploits the exogenous timing of the research's dissemination to cabinet members within a window of a few days. We find that exposure to public opinion research leads politicians to markedly change their speech. First, we show that linguistic similarity between political speech and public opinion research increases significantly after reports are passed on to the cabinet, suggesting that politicians change the topics they address. Second, we demonstrate that exposure to public opinion research alters politicians' substantive positions in the direction of majority opinion.</div>

<b><a href="papers/ExFelon.pdf">Locked Out of College:
When Admissions Bureaucrats Do and Do Not
Discriminate</a></b>
(with Jacob Brown). Forthcoming, <i> British Journal of Political Science.</i> 

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> How does a criminal record shape interactions with the State and society? We present evidence
from a nationwide field experiment, showing that prospective applicants with criminal records
are about five percentage points less likely to receive information from college admission offices.
However, we demonstrate that bias does not extend to race. There is no difference in
response rates to Black and White applicants. We further show that bias is all but absent in
public bureaucracies, as discrimination against formerly incarcerated applicants is driven by
private schools. Examining why bias is stronger for private colleges, we demonstrate that the
private-public difference persists even after accounting for college selectivity, socio-economic
composition and school finances. Moving beyond the measurement of bias, we evaluate an intervention
aimed at reducing discrimination: whether an email from an advocate mitigates bias
associated with a criminal record. However, we find no evidence that advocate endorsements
decrease bureaucratic bias. </div>

<b><a href="papers/Misperceptions.pdf">Diverse News Media Decreases Misperceptions about Immigration </a></b>
(with Sascha Riaz). R&#38;R, <i> British Journal of Political Science.</i> 

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('misperceptions');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="misperceptions" style="display:none;"><br> What are the sources of misperceptions about immigrants? We examine how diversity
in the market for local news affects misperceptions about the size of the immigrant
population in Germany. We propose a theoretical framework in which heterogeneous
information from different news outlets diffuses through social interactions. We posit
that exposure to diverse information leads to more accurate perceptions in competitive
markets. To causally identify the effect of news media diversity on misperceptions,
we exploit overlapping newspaper coverage areas as a source of exogenous variation
in the number of available outlets. We estimate that local news monopolies increase
misperceptions by 38%. We empirically demonstrate that the effect of diverse media
hinges on interactions in social networks. For individuals with fewer social connections, misperceptions remain unaffected by media diversity. Our results suggest that
consolidation in the market for news decreases constituents' knowledge about critical
policy issues.</div>

<b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/syr84/">Wealth of Tongues: Why Peripheral Regions Vote for the Radical Right in Germany
</a></b>
(with Daniel Bischof and Daniel Ziblatt).

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('dialect');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="dialect" style="display:none;"><br> Why do voters for the radical right tend to cluster in specific geographic locations? Many scholars have emphasized the economic roots of radical right support. Other scholarship highlights the role of the urban-rural divide, contending that the radical right finds support in low population density locations due to distinctive social values and strong place-based social identities found in rural areas. To date, however, we do not have a full grasp of the sources of these latter factors nor an understanding of the historical roots that explain their emergence. We argue that what is frequently classified as the "rural" bases of radical right support in previous research is in part a proxy for something entirely different: communities that were in the historical "periphery" in the center-periphery conflicts that shaped modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature that emphasizes the prevalence of a "wealth of tongues" (Weber 1976) - or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a region - as a definition of the periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a linguistic survey in Germany to show that voters from historically peripheral geographic communities are more likely to vote for the radical right today </div>
